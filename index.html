          Hello! I'm Devon Davidson and I am currently a student. I have been interested in computer science since I was very young. It always caught my attention and I knew from very early on that computer science was what I wanted to do.
          I have been learning about programming for most of my life and am really excited to get into the field.

        <div class="what">
          I am currently attending Ozarks Technical Community College. I am in the Computer Science Program and am working on getting my Associates Degree. I am focusing on C# but also learning other fields such as web development and mobile app
          development.
          My degree has a strong focus on math, so many of my classes are math-related. I will soon be getting into database classes which will help me on my way to becoming a well-rounded programmer.

          One of my favorite hobbies is what I would call "tinkering". I challenge myself to create something functional out of components I already have. The picture included here is of one my favorite projects. It wasn't easy getting all those
          wires to fit in a case that small.
          Another one of my hobbies is just writing code. I'll leave a link <a href="connect4/Connect4.html" target="_blank">here</a> to the first substantial program I have created.

        <div class="what">
          I will be graduating in May of 2022 and hope to go staright into the field. I believe that I will enjoy any job involving programming and look forward to the many exciting opportunities that await me after my graduation. My dream job would
          absolutely be to work on developing video games.
          While that is a goal of mine, I would enjoy and work hard as any kind of programmer.
